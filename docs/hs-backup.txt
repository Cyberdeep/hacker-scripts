DESCRIPTION
-----------

hs-backup

This command will automatically create a backup of the
directories that you add in the configuration. The backup location
is also set in the configuration itself. The script uses the windows
'ROBOCOPY' command to backup the files more efficiently and quickly.

Each time a backup is complete the log is appended to the backup log
file which can be found in the hacker-scripts directory itself.

The log is automatically cleared after the size exceeds 1 MB.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Here's an example configuration:

[hs-backup]
	purge = 0
	retries = 10
	backup_location = D:\
	directory1 = C:\Users\Areeb\Documents\GitHub
	directory2 = C:\Users\Areeb\Desktop\Python
	directory3 = C:\Users\Areeb\Desktop\Files

1. PURGE

PURGE may have 2 values, either 0 (i.e off) or 1 (i.e on)

If PURGE is on then the files that do not exist in the source anymore
will be deleted from the backup location. If you prefer to keep deleted files
on your backup then set it to 0.

2. RETRIES

This is the number of times ROBOCOPY should retry the backup if it fails.
In ROBOCOPY by default this value is 1 million (1000000), you probably would
want a lower value on a personal computer.

3. BACKUP_LOCATION

This is where all your files will be backed up to. Usually this would be another
drive.

4. DIRECTORIES

These are the directories that you want to create a backup of, each time the command 
is run.
