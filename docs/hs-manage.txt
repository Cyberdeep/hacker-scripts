DESCRIPTION
-----------

hs-manage

This is a useful command/script that will manage all the files in a given directory
(passed as an argument) by moving the files whose extensions are in a given list
of extensions (set in the configuration) to the directory (which again is set in the
configuration) they should be in.

If you used hs-config and took a look at the configuration file, you'll notice that
there are preset values for extension_set_[1-3], don't worry those are not anything
permanent. You can change or remove them if you want or keep them and set the locations.

Those are the extensions of 3 most common file types that people have viz documents, images
and videos.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Here's an example configuration:

[hs-manage]
    extension_set_1  = .txt, .ppt, .doc, .xml
    location_1       = C:\Users\Areeb\Desktop\Files
    extension_set_2  = .jpg, .png, .gif
    location_2       = E:\Media\Images
    extension_set_3  = .avi, .mp4, .mkv, .flv, .wmv, .m4v, .mpg, .3gp, .3g2, .f4v
    location_3       = E:\Media\Videos

1. EXTENSION_SETS

The files with their extensions in extension_set_<x> will be moved to the directory
in location_<x>.

2. LOCATIONS

Well, it's self explanatory.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- When you enter extensions they must be in the same format as in the above example,
no extra brackets or punctuations.

- For each extension_set_x option there should be a location_x option and vice versa.
